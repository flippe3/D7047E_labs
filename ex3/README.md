### Comment on the differences between PCA and t-SNE
t-SNE manages to cluster together the data far better than PCA manages to.

### Comment on the first model (virtually not trained at all) and the second one
The first PCA model is very messy and outside of number 1 class it is difficult to see any pattern. Compare that to the trained version of PCA you can see that clusters have formed and although the clusters are not perfect they are certainly better than the untrained model.

For t-SNE the first model already has made a very good cluster and you can clearly differentiate the classes. If you compare the first t-SNE to the second you can see that even though both do a pretty good job the trained model has clusters that are a bit more dense.
